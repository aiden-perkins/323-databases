# Note - The 'connect string' shown in db_connection only goes so far as to specify the

# Be sure to create the proper schema in the postgresql database BEFORE trying to run
# this code, SQLAlchemy will not do that for you.

# If nothing is entered when input prompts the user for the schema, then the 'or' string gets a
# null string for the first argument which evaluates to false, which means that the
# boolean expression takes the right-hand argument as its output and passes that in to the
# MetaData constructor.
